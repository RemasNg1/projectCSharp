# Project Overview

This project is a basic C# console application designed to help a user input and manage student grades. The program allows the user to enter a student's name and grade, and add an unlimited number of students. At the end of the input process, the program displays the students' names and grades, marking each student as Failed if their grade is below 60, or Passed if the grade is 60 or higher.
